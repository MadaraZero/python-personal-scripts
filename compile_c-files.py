- Script version: 0.7
- Requires gcc compiler <sudo apt install gcc>
- Valgrind is useful, but not necessary <sudo apt-get install valgrind>
- This script works for the Ubuntu OS, a Mac OS version might need adjustments.

This script is intended to help those out that have recently started to learn C
but don't know how to execute C files. Place the script in the same folder as
your C file before using.
